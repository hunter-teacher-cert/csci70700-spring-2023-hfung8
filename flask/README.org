Project url: https://replit.com/@HarrisonFung1/Flask-project

Repl link : https://Flask-project.harrisonfung1.repl.co

routes used : 
a) '/'
b) '/unit1' 
c) '/vocab'

Flask part 2 additions: 

d) '/status' route used to check if you are in secret room. 
e) '/login' form page for the login part 

I made this part with very little css compared to the first flask assignment. It was harder for me to complete it.
